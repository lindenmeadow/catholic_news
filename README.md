# CatholicNews

Welcome to CatholicNews!
This is a CLI Ruby project that I have created as part of my web developer studies through Flatiron School.
CatholicNews 'scrapes' the first news headlines page of the site catholicnewsagency.com. First, it presents the user with a numbered list of the headlines from that page. Next, it allows the user to select a headline from the list, thereby displaying the headline again along with the story's date, teaser, and URL. The user may then select another headline, view the list of headlines again, or exit the program. 
The project's purpose is to demonstrate a CLI object-oriented application by using Ruby elements such as modules, classes, variables, and methods. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'catholic_news'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install catholic_news

## Usage

Execute the program and follow the prompts.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
